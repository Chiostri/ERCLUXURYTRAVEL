           <p>Why take my word for it?  Read my comments from my clients below<p/>
                                  
                 <p>We did a quick tour of the Sistine Chapel at the end of the trip. While looking up at the ceiling, we noticed several balconies. <br>
                            Michael said, ‚ÄúI bet Erika could have got us a seat up there.‚Äù <br> That is how we felt about working with you and our experience of the trip. Thank You!  -Nancy</p>
       
           <p>Hey Erika What a beautiful place wish we had time to relax here <br> They upgraded to a suite. All good.As the trip is winding down<br> 
                      it has been amazing.  Thank you. Big hug (A very famous Hollywood Film Producer) </p>
                                
                                 <p> First of all, I would NEVER worry about ANYTHING that is in YOUR hands‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶EVER, EVER, EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE YOU, Lora </P
                                 
                                

                                 <p> Erika, I certainly want to thank you for guiding Laurie and I to a life time experience of 14 days in Africa.<br>  
                                     I am sure it will be best to hear from Laurie directly but she has shared with others that it was amazing<br>
                                     wonderful and magical.  The safaris were great and our guides Kenosi Botswana (One of seven master trackers <br>
                                     in the world) Kruegaer, along with a one hour tour guide in Zimbabwe named Joseph transported us to another world.<br>  
                                     Marcus in Cape Town was equally outstanding and found the most amazing balance between the obscure and the obvious <br>
                                     of things to see from FranceHook to Boulders Beach and literally all points and table mtns in between.  But none of <br>
                                     this would have been possible if were not for very best guide..... you.  Warm regards - Robert </P>

                                     the trip was one of our favorites ever and you have planned 20 years of trips for us and each one is better than<br> 
                                     the last </p>

                                     <p> Erika- our travel experience was the best ever.  Sixteen people and three generations of family and everyone <br>
                                     concluded that this was our best vacation and most memorable.  My brother-in-law and sister and my brother told <br>
                                     my parents that they have ‚Äúruined‚Äù their children because of the first-class treatment we received. The bar is set<br>
                                     high now so nothing can come close unless we replicate this vacation for other excursions>  Love, Donna </P>
